I worked at DD Studio in Carlsbad, CA and had the opportunity to be involved in some interesting projects. One of these was the Rainbird Sprinkler systems, which DD Studio helped design the interface for. Some of the models I worked on were quite advanced, some had very tiny digital displays that required bitmap artwork. Another project I enjoyed working on was the Eco ATM machine. Using a touchscreen, anyone in a mall could walk up to a vending machine and sell their electronic device. I aided in some of the animations, drawings, and concept artwork for the exterior.
