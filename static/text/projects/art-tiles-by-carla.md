Carla Funk is an artist from Encinitas, CA, USA. She has spent years fine tuning her craft along with hosting art camps for children. Designed and developed with her style and needs in mind, Carla's website is a gateway to everything she is involved in. For Carla, the best part of the website might be the behind the scenes CMS I created. Now, she is able to add new events to her website and drag/drop photos to create picture galleries.
